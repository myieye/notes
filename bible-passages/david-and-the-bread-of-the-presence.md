# David and the bread of the Presence (Mk. 2:25-26)

> *25 And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: 26 how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?”*

## Intro

### Context

Jesus' disciples are plucking and eating grain on the Sabbath. Jesus is obviously fine with that. The Pharisees accuse them of breaking the Sabbath.

Jesus addresses the accusations (in part) by bringing up this account of ancient history. "Don't you remember what David did? David ate the bread of the Presence. Why is that interesting? Because he wasn't lawfully allowed to eat the bread." Jesus seems to imply: "And God seemed to be okay with it right? What do you do with **that** story?"

### This **is** tricky!

What *do* we do with that story?

Was it not *actually* unlawful to eat the bread? Was the law misunderstood?

Or did it not *matter* that it was unlawful? Can it be okay to break the law?

And what does Jesus' next statement have to do with this puzzle?

> *27 And he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.*

### Getting organized

Here's what we have to do to start trying to understand this correctly:

1. Understand what the bread is really about: what it's for, what it represents and what the law says about it
2. Pick up the details of what David and his men really did
3. Figure out why it was acceptable for them to eat the bread
4. Determine what point Jesus was making

## Digging Deep*er*

### 1. What's the bread of the Presence?

### 2. What did David's men do?

### 3. Why was it acceptable to eat the bread?

### 4. What point was Jesus making?
